When writing tests in this project:

1. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Write descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
3. Each test should verify one specific behavior
4. Use meaningful test data and avoid magic numbers
5. Mock external dependencies appropriately
6. Test both success and failure cases
7. Keep tests independent and isolated
8. Use proper setup and teardown
9. Document complex test scenarios
10. Maintain high test coverage for critical paths

Remember: Tests are documentation. Make them clear and maintainable.
